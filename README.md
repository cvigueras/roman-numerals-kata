# roman-numerals-kata
Create arabic numbers in roman numbers.

The Roman numerals kata attempts to create a conversion mechanism from integers to a Roman representation (a string):

* 1, 2 and 3 become I, II and III respectively.
* 5 and 10 become V and X respectively.
* 6 become VI, as symbols are additive.
* 4 becomes IV, as symbols are used subtractively (in this case subtracting 1 from 5) to avoid repeating a symbol more than three times in a row.
